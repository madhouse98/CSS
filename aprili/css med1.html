        Decentralized exchanges (abbreviated DEXs) as alternative payment ecosystems with new protocols for financial transactions emerged within the framework of decentralized finance,[5] which is part of blockchain technology and FinTech.[6] Unlike centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs), such as Coinbase, Huobi or Binance, which use order books to match buyers and sellers on the open market and keep crypto assets in an exchange-based wallet, DEXs are non-custodial and leverage the functionality of self-executing smart contracts for peer-to-peer trading, while users retain control of their private keys and funds.[7]

Most recently, DEX aggregators have begun to play a more distinctive part in the DEX segment. DEX aggregators form user-centric hubs that compose to several applications and protocols, also providing tools to compare and rate services, which allow users to perform otherwise complex tasks by connecting to several protocols simultaneously.[8] CEXs, DEXs and DEX aggregators are all built on the multi-layered DeFi architecture or components, where each layer serves a well-defined purpose.[5] (See Figure: Multi-layered Architecture of the DeFi Stack).

While they share common components of the first four layers, such as Settlement layer, Asset layer, Protocol layer and Application layer, DEX aggregators have an additional component or Aggregator layer, which allows them to connect and interact with other DEXs via smart contracts.[9]

The Ethereum blockchain popularised smart contracts, which are the basis of DeFi, in 2017. Other blockchains have since implemented smart contracts.

MakerDAO is a prominent lending DeFi platform based on a stablecoin that was established in 2017.[10][11] It allows users to borrow Dai, a token pegged to the US dollar. Through a set of smart contracts that govern the loan, repayment, and liquidation processes, MakerDAO aims to maintain the stable value of Dai in a decentralized and autonomous manner.[12][13]

In June 2020, Compound Finance started rewarding lenders and borrowers with cryptocurrencies, in addition to typical interest payments to lenders, units of a cryptocurrency called COMP. This token, which is used for running Compound, can also be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. Other platforms followed suit, leading to "yield farming" or "liquidity mining," where speculators shift cryptocurrency assets between pools in a platform and between platforms to maximize their total yield, which includes not only interest and fees but also the value of additional tokens received as rewards.[14]

In July 2020, The Washington Post described decentralized finance techniques and the risks involved.[14] In September 2020, Bloomberg said that DeFi made up two-thirds of the cryptocurrency market in terms of price changes and that DeFi collateral levels had reached $9 billion.[15] Ethereum saw a rise in developers during 2020 due to the increased interest in DeFi.[16]

DeFi has attracted venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz[3] and Michael Novogratz.[17]

The Economist regarded the future of digital finance in 2022 as a "three-way fight" between: Big Tech, such as Facebook with its digital wallet; "big rich countries" that have been testing their own digital currencies; and software developers "building all sorts of applications" to decentralise finance. Handling the risks presented by crypto-assets already valued at $2.5 trillion was a particular challenge for US regulators.[18]
